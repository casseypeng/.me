          <h5>BRAINSTORM</h5>
          <p>I selected a sound clip from one of my favourite movies, Finding Nemo. It is a jellyfish hop-out scene with a strong sense of rhythm, an interesting narrative, and dynamic background musics.</p>
          </div>

          </div>

          <h5>CHALLENGE</h5>
          <p>In the design of my script animation, I separated my work into three – graphic design of each frame, animation design, and transition design between the each scenes. First, I drew the storyboard of every dialogue (i.e., one shot of each dialogue) and make sure each of them is applying visual design principles. After that, I listened to each dialogue and focused on the animation design in each shot. Then, I worked on the transition between scenes and combined it with the animations. By separating the work, I can focus on graphic design, animation design, and transition design separately, and maximize the quality of each of them.</p>
          </div>
          <img id="nemo-storyboard" alt="nemo-storyboard" src="img/storyboard.jpg">

          <p>The largest challenge I have encountered in this project is that two characters’ sounds are sometimes overlapping. When transferring to the script typography, the hierarchy is hard to show. I listened carefully and told apart whose dialogue is the major one. Then I put the major dialogue in a higher hierarchy and the minor one as a decorative element. For instance, in the scene that Dory is adventuring in the ocean while Marlin is asking her to be careful, I put Dory’s scripts as the leading ones while made Marlin’s small and transient. By doing this, I respond to the sense that Dory immersed in her own world and ignored Marlin’s warning.</p>

          </div>

          <p>I also watched others’ kinetic typography artworks and learned from them. In particular, a cross fading transition between texts from a Taiwanese singer Yoga Lin’s music video Si Fan (produced by Taiwanese director Bill Chia). I did a very similar transition as it in Si Fan, and added a bit waving effect to fit the ocean environment. </p>

          <h6>Knitting</h6>
          <p>I knitted the effects and transitions in order to engage the audience. Before one visual effect ended, I pumped out another one, thus the kinetic typography was knitted with various animations. By doing this, I aimed to catch the audience’s attention with  continuous animations.</p>

          <h6>Background</h6>
          <p>Instead of using a plain background, I imitated an ocean environment to fit the story context. Beside, the wave in the background moves in different speed based on the story development, which makes it more engaging.</p>
